# 2023_TBVaccine_Confidence

In this repository you will find two files: 

## Main analysis of 2023 VCP data

It also includes the calculation of the overall combined confidence scored based on these individual scores. 

## Sex- and age-group-disaggregated analysis of 2023 VCP data

This includes the analytical code to obtain confidence scores by sex and age group for each of the 18 high TB burden countries in the dataset.
